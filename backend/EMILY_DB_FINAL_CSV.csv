6,Fruit Gallette,"For the dough: Mix the flour and salt. Cut or work the butter into the flour with a pastry blender or your fingertips, leaving some of the butter in fairly large, irregular pieces. This will take 1 or 2 minutes. (or mix for no more than a minute, ad medium-low speed, in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) Pour in three quarters of the water, stirring all the while with a fork until the dough begins to form clumps. (In the mixer, turn the speed to low and pour the water down the sides of the bowl, mixing for 30 seconds or less.) Keep adding water if needed. Bring together into a ball, and wrap in plastic.

Cook 15 minutes at a low simmer, until tender but not too soft. You will still have water left in the pan. Once the squash is cooked to your liking, take off the heat and reserve the liquid to add to your risotto. + If your stock is cold, add it to a saucepan, bring and hold at simmer until you are ready to add it to your rice. + Meanwhile, cut the remaining sage leaves and cut your onion in a 1/2” dice. + In a heavy bottom saucepan, heat 1.5 tbs of butter over medium heat.

If it is taking significantly more, raise the heat. + Cook until the rice is tender but still has a firm core. The final addition of liquid is the most important: add just enough to finish cooking the rice without leaving it soupy. + Stir in the cooked squash, 1/2 cup of the reserved squash liquid, 1 tablespoon of butter, and the cheese. + Continue cooking for a few more minutes until most of the liquid has been absorbed, but risotto can still slide easily in the pan.
